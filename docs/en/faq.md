# FAQ

## Under which licence is ALYS?
ALYS is subject to multiple licences depending on its components.

ALYSâ€™ configuration files are under free licence
[`GPL-3.0`](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.fr.html).

Documentation files are under free licence
[`FDL-1.3`](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.fr.html).

The audio files are under a licence specific to ALYS, the restrictive
licence [`ALYS-1.0`](/en/ALYS-1.0.md). This licence can be summarised
as follows:
- Any person is free to access ALYS audio files without restriction;
- Any person has the right to use the ALYS audio files for vocal
  synthesis within the framework in which this vocal synthesis occurs
  via the Alter/Ego, UTAU, or OpenUTAU software;
- Any person is free to modify ALYS audio files within the framework
  described above;
- Anyone is free to redistribute the audio files, provided they remain
  under the same licence;
- It is strictly forbidden to change the licence of the audio files or
  to sell them.

The other components of ALYS (trademark, design, voice) are not
covered by the above licences but by other licences held by their
rightful owners.

## Can I redistribute ALYS?
Absolutely, as long as the files redistributed comply with their
respective licences.

Regarding its physical appearance and branding, as long as no
commercial use is made of it, there shouldn't be any problem either,
but it is strongly recommended that you contact the copyright holders
in case of doubt.

Redistribution of audio files for any use other than their intended
use as described by the ALYS-1.0 licence can only take place with
Poucet's express permission.

## Is ALYS maintained?
From a vocal library point of view, Lucien (the original ALYS
developer) no longer updates either ALYS4AE or ALYS4UTAU. Updates may
be proposed on the source file repositories to improve the vocal
libraries, but they will only be accepted at Lucien's discretion.

ALYS for DiffSinger is outside Lucien's domain. The team behind
DiffSinger, [UFR](https://utaufrance.com/), should be contacted
instead.

## Are there any plans for LEORA?
There are no plans for the moment. This depends, among other things,
on the will of the rights holders. Please avoid any unsolicited
communication with former VoxWave members regarding LEORA.
